"""
Case 7.1
Byzantine node 0 tells some nodes that its view is (1,1) and others that it is (2,2)
The Byzantine node tries to trick some nodes to migrate to view (2,2), while telling
others to stay in (1,1).
All correct nodes should stay in the current view (1,1) since not enough nodes seems
to be wanting a view change to (2,2). Meaning the Byz node should NOT be able to trick
the correct nodes.
